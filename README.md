### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** at **LinkedIn**, building Sales Navigator.

I continually pushes the boundaries of my expertise in **Java**, **Scala**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, and **Python**, along with **big data** tech stacks of **Spark**, **Hadoop**, **Kafka**, and **Samza**.

My journey has led me through a dynamic range of projects; from finessing offline job pipelines, sculpting a new data platform, to designing and refining important features on LinkedIn's enterprise products. This career path fuels my passion for creating efficient, user-focused products, and I'm always on the road of constructing the next significant impact.
